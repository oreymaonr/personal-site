I am currently working as a Werkstudent (Student Assistant) at Fraunhofer IFAM (Fraunhofer-Institut für Fertigungstechnik und Angewandte Materialforschung IFAM), Bremen, where I contribute to research and development through simulation and automation tasks using Python, ANSYS Electronics Desktop, and PyAEDT. This role allows me to apply my technical knowledge in real-world scenarios and collaborate on interdisciplinary projects at one of Germany’s leading applied research institutes.
<br/><br/>
Previously, I worked as an Assistant Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., where I was part of the development team for The Home Depot in the retail domain. My responsibilities included web application development, migration, and deployment, with a strong focus on writing well-tested, maintainable code, producing clear documentation, and working closely with clients in Agile/Scrum environments. I am proficient in C++, Java, Python, and Dart.
<br/><br/>
Alongside my professional roles, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Electronics with a specialization in Intelligent Sensors and Instrumentation at Hochschule Bremen. I possess strong communication skills in English and functional working proficiency in German.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I enjoy building personal projects such as a [Plant Care App](https://github.com/oreymaonr/Adenium), developed using Flutter/Dart, featuring timeline-based fertilizing reminders, local JSON-based storage, dark/light theme options, multilingual support, and notification scheduling. I also work with Jupyter notebooks and NumPy for data visualization and analysis, particularly in applications related to electronics and sensor data.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, I designed and soldered a Biquad Filter to isolate specific frequencies—especially useful for removing carrier signals from mixed-frequency inputs. This project refreshed my hands-on skills in technologies such as KiCAD for schematic and PCB design, as well as SMD soldering techniques.
<br/><br/>
Beyond technical interests, I enjoy playing Minecraft and Skyrim, and reading literature—especially classics like 1984, Les Misérables, and Crime and Punishment, as well as modern novels like Kafka on the Shore.
